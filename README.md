# College-Project-Python-feedbackplease
So this project was part of a 5 hour coding exam where i had to add security features and show trends and patterns in  given data.
I would appreciate if someone could take a look at it i struggled with most on turning the data into graphs especially using datetimeframe aspects.
Im still very new to learning Python! 

This exam was a mock and i have a similar one in a few weeks :)
